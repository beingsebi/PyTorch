The essence of machine learning and deep learning is to take some data from the past, build an algorithm (like a neural network) to discover patterns in it and use the discovered patterns to predict the future.

Specifically, we're going to cover:

<tr>
  <td><strong>1. Getting data ready</strong></td>
  <td>Data can be almost anything but to get started we're going to create a simple straight line</td>
</tr>

  <td><strong>2. Building a model</strong></td>
  <td>Here we'll create a model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a <strong>loss function</strong>, <strong>optimizer</strong> and build a <strong>training loop</strong>.</td>

  <td><strong>3. Fitting the model to data (training)</strong></td>
  <td>We've got data and a model, now let's let the model (try to) find patterns in the (<strong>training</strong>) data.</td>

  <td><strong>4. Making predictions and evaluating a model (inference)</strong></td>
  <td>Our model's found patterns in the data, let's compare its findings to the actual (<strong>testing</strong>) data.</td>

<tr>
  <td><strong>5. Saving and loading a model</strong></td>
  <td>You may want to use your model elsewhere, or come back to it later, here we'll cover that.</td>

  <td><strong>6. Putting it all together</strong></td>
  <td>Let's take all of the above and combine it.</td>

Again, it's best to learn via examples. Let's build a basic model that learns the pattern of a straight line and matches it. The model learns by *studying* `(x,y)` pairs, and after that, for given `x` values, it return corresponding `y` values.

## 0. Prerequisites
```py
import torch
from torch import nn # nn contains all of PyTorch's building blocks for neural networks
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
```

## 1. Data preparing and loading
```py
# Create *known* parameters
weight = 0.7
bias = 0.3

# Create data
start = 0
end = 1
step = 0.02
X = torch.arange(start, end, step).unsqueeze(dim=1)
y = weight * X + bias
X[:5], y[:5]
```

```cpp
(tensor([[0.0000],
         [0.0200],
         [0.0400],
         [0.0600],
         [0.0800]]),
 tensor([[0.3000],
         [0.3140],
         [0.3280],
         [0.3420],
         [0.3560]]))
```

###  Splitting data into training and test sets

One of most important steps in a machine learning project is creating a training and test set (and when required, a validation set).

Each split of the dataset serves a specific purpose:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Split</th>
  <th>Purpose</th>
  <th>Amount of total data</th>
  <th>How often is it used?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Training set</strong></td>
  <td>The model learns from this data (like the course materials you study during the semester).</td>
  <td>~60-80%</td>
  <td>Always</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Validation set</strong></td>
  <td>The model gets tuned on this data (like the practice exam you take before the final exam).</td>
  <td>~10-20%</td>
  <td>Often but not always</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Testing set</strong></td>
  <td>The model gets evaluated on this data to test what it has learned (like the final exam you take at the end of the semester).</td>
  <td>~10-20%</td>
  <td>Always</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For now, we'll just use a training and test set, this means we'll have a dataset for our model to learn on as well as be evaluated on. We can create them by splitting our `X` and `y` tensors.
```py
# Create train/test split
train_split = int(0.8 * len(X)) # 80% of data used for training set, 20% for testing 
X_train, y_train = X[:train_split], y[:train_split]
X_test, y_test = X[train_split:], y[train_split:]

len(X_train), len(y_train), len(X_test), len(y_test)
```

```cpp
(40, 40, 10, 10)
```

The model we create is going to try and learn the relationship between `X_train` and `y_train` and then we will evaluate what it learns on `X_test` and `y_test`.

But right now our data is just numbers on a page. Let's create a function to visualize it.
```py
def plot_predictions(train_data=X_train,train_labels=y_train,test_data=X_test,test_labels=y_test,predictions=None):
  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
  plt.scatter(train_data, train_labels, c="b", s=4, label="Training data") # Plot training data in blue
  plt.scatter(test_data, test_labels, c="g", s=4, label="Testing data") # Plot test data in green
  if predictions is not None:
    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)
    plt.scatter(test_data, predictions, c="r", s=4, label="Predictions")
  plt.legend(prop={"size": 14}); # Show the legend
plot_predictions()
```

## 2. Build a model

Now we've got some data, let's build a model to use the blue dots to predict the green dots.
